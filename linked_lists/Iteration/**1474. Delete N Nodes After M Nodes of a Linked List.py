"""
You are given the head of a linked list and two integers m and n.

Traverse the linked list and remove some nodes in the following way:

Start with the head as the current node.
Keep the first m nodes starting with the current node.
Remove the next n nodes
Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until you reach the end of the list.
Return the head of the modified list after removing the mentioned nodes.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13], m = 2, n = 3
Output: [1,2,6,7,11,12]
Explanation: Keep the first (m = 2) nodes starting from the head of the linked List  (1 ->2) show in black nodes.
Delete the next (n = 3) nodes (3 -> 4 -> 5) show in read nodes.
Continue with the same procedure until reaching the tail of the Linked List.
Head of the linked list after removing nodes is returned.
