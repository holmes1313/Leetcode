"""
You are given a 0-indexed circular string array words and a string target. A circular array means that the array's end connects to the array's beginning.

Formally, the next element of words[i] is words[(i + 1) % n] and the previous element of words[i] is words[(i - 1 + n) % n], where n is the length of words.
Starting from startIndex, you can move to either the next word or the previous word with 1 step at a time.

Return the shortest distance needed to reach the string target. If the string target does not exist in words, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["hello","i","am","leetcode","hello"], target = "hello", startIndex = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: We start from index 1 and can reach "hello" by
- moving 3 units to the right to reach index 4.
- moving 2 units to the left to reach index 4.
- moving 4 units to the right to reach index 0.
- moving 1 unit to the left to reach index 0.
The shortest distance to reach "hello" is 1.
