Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2
