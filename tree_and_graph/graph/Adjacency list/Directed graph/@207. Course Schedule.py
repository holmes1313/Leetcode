"""
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
Example 2:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
 

Constraints:

1 <= numCourses <= 2000
0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000
prerequisites[i].length == 2
0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
All the pairs prerequisites[i] are unique.

        Steps for Kahn's Algorithm (BFS-based approach):
        1.Build an adjacency list to represent the graph of courses and their prerequisites.
        2.Calculate the in-degree for each course. The in-degree represents how many prerequisites each course has (i.e., how many edges point to it).
        3.Use a queue to perform a topological sort:
        (a) Start with all courses that have an in-degree of 0 (i.e., no prerequisites).
        (b) For each course processed, reduce the in-degree of its dependent courses. If a dependent courseâ€™s in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.
        (c) Keep tracking of the courses as you process them.
